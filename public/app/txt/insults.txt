You fight like a dairy farmer.
Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish-kabob!
You're no match for my brains, you poor fool.
This is the end for you, you gutter-crawling cur!
There are no words for how disgusting you are.
I'm not going to take your insolence sitting down!
People fall at my feet when they see me coming.
I've heard you are a contemptible sneak.
My handkerchief will wipe up your blood!
You are a pain in the backside, sir!
There are no clever moves that can help you now.
My name is feared in every dirty corner of this island!
